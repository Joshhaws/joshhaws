              I'm passionate about making life better with technology.
              I develop full stack solutions, and I especially enjoy front-end development and working with Amazon Web Services. 
              I enjoy learning about new technologies and innovating to solve problems.
              I thrive in team settings where I can work collaboratively with my peers.
